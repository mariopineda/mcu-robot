## Motorcontroller
The L293D is a 16-pin Motor Driver IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction.
The L293D is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA (per channel) at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V (at pin 8!). You can use it to control small dc motors - toy motors. Sometimes it can be extremely hot.
