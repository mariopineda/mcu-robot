# mcu-robot
In this assignment you will be building an obstacle avoiding mobile robot. The robot will be based on your breadboarded mcu. 

## Step 1: Motorcontroller
The L293D is a 16-pin Motor Driver IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction.
The L293D is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA (per channel) at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V (at pin 8!). You can use it to control small dc motors - toy motors. Sometimes it can be extremely hot.

## Step 2: Ultrasonic Sensor

## Step 3: Ultrasonic Sensor interfacing with motorcontroller

## Step 4: Robot Chassi
The robot chassi has to be well-designed and make good use of the approved materials. The design needs to be innovative and needs to work properly with the robot circuit and the mechanical (moving) parts. You will be provided with one hardboard and one castor wheel for our chassi. You can also use the following materials:

* cardboard
* salvaged parts from the teardown project
* paper rolls (from toilet paper or paper tissues)
* boxes (e.g. from tissue)
* styrofoam
* lids from milk jugs and jars
* food containers (cans, tins, cups, etc)
* tupperware
* rubber bands
* string, glue, tape
* wood/lumber
* 3D printed parts

You are not allowed to use the following materials:
* glass
* building kits (e.g. LEGO, etc)
* prebuild vehicles or vehicle parts (toy cars, wheels etc)

Keep the following things in mind when you design the chassi:
* The chassi of the robot needs to be sturdy and reinforced properly, particularly if you are using cardboard. Having bumpers is a good idea as your robot might be bumping into things.
* Be mindful of the center of gravity. If your breadboard and motors are placed all the way to the front of the robot there is a risk that the robot might end up being front heavy and have a tendency to tip over.
* The robot needs to have two powerd wheels and a castor wheel for the third contact point. 
* Your robot will be marked on attractiveness and innovative design (it has to be neat-looking. Tip: use colors and decorate it).
* During construction and testing the robot will be powered by your battery pack. 
* The breadboard cannot be glued or permanently attached to the chassi as this will damage the breadboard.
